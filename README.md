# Pirate Weather Dynamic Location

Home Assistant custom integration that keeps a Pirate Weather config entry aligned with a moving GPS position.

It watches configurable latitude and longitude sensor entities, measures movement from the last successfully applied location, and updates the selected Pirate Weather integration once the configured distance threshold is exceeded.

## Version

Current release: **1.0.0**

## Requirements

- Home Assistant
- The Pirate Weather integration already configured
- Sensor entities that provide latitude and longitude values

## Installation

1. Create `config/custom_components/pirateweather_dynamic_location/` in your Home Assistant configuration directory.
2. Copy the integration files from this repository into that directory, keeping the `translations` folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Open **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration**.
5. Search for **Pirate Weather Dynamic Location**.

## Configuration

The setup flow lets you choose the GPS latitude and longitude sensors, the movement threshold in kilometres, a debounce delay, and the Pirate Weather config entry to update.

Defaults:

- Latitude: `sensor.rutx50_gps_lat`
- Longitude: `sensor.rutx50_gps_lon`
- Movement threshold: **25 km**
- Debounce: **2 seconds**

## Sensors

The integration exposes:

- **Distance since last update** — movement from the last successfully applied Pirate Weather location.
- **Last updated** — timestamp of the last successful location change.

## How it works

When either GPS entity changes, the integration waits for the debounce period and reads both coordinates. Once movement exceeds the configured threshold, it updates only latitude and longitude on the selected Pirate Weather config entry and reloads Pirate Weather. The last successfully applied position is persisted across Home Assistant restarts.

## Multiple Pirate Weather instances

If you have more than one Pirate Weather config entry, select the intended target in this integration's options. With no explicit target, the first available Pirate Weather entry is used.
